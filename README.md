# 📱 Marco Witt — iOS App Portfolio

Welcome to my public iOS app portfolio.  
This repository provides an overview of selected iOS projects, focusing on architecture, UI/UX decisions, and technical structure.

Most of my professional work is private due to client and employer projects.  
The apps shown here are intended to demonstrate my **architecture choices, UI/UX focus, and technical depth**.
